Finally I can sort things out. I've updated Notable Events with everything that was missing for July and August. On that front, only the KI Live for July is missing, which will be done this week or next week. I've also updated VH&N with all the patches since the initial summer patch and fixed the version in Introduction. I've also had to scrub out the Upcoming Content page apart from the overview photo because populating that will take more time than I thought.","06/12/2021 (12/06) @ 15:15 GMT (v1.12 - major): The largest upkeep task for NubHub since release has now been completed.

Roughly a week in the works with 100+ edits, welcome to the improved Upcoming Content page! That said, Upcoming Content is now cleaner and more user friendly. Upcoming Content (Archive) has been removed for reworks. In other news, Notable Events has been updated to recent events (plushie anyone?), plus VH&N and Tutorial have been updated to (V_r704733.Wizard_1_460).

The last one, HousingObject3, was created ~ Mar 17, 2016 - with no clear reason. Anyway, let's break it down.","TreasureCards-WorldData.wad (DYN)- Contains all spell animations and Sound Effects. This includes spells for Fishing and Gardening as well as Lore packs. File also (obviously) has the textures for these spells.","Wizard101 is located at C:/Prograta/KingsIsle Entertainment/Wizard101.","WizardClient.log- Useful to understanding how the game functions behind the scenes and also logs errors so useful for troubleshooting.","WizardGraphicalClient.exe- The game, sometimes useful but usually untouched."]},{"l":"Patcher Intro","p":["The files are hosted on http://versionec.us.wizard101.com- this houses all the game files for Wizard101.","The current version is necessary (since October 2018) to download files directly from the Patcher. This is necessary if you wish to extract content in some of the larger files that is only 'loaded' when required for use.","The directory structure is the same - wad files are in the GameData folder. You can find the Patcher at the top of this post.","WizPatcher/V_rXXXXXX.Wizard_1_XXX/LatestBuild/Data/GameData/Root.wad for live","WizPatcher/V_rXXXXXX.WizardDev/LatestBuild/Data/GameData/Root.wad for test."]},{"l":"Dynamic Files","p":["Many of the larger files are dynamic. This means that for the contents of the file to exist in Dynamic files, it has to be downloaded from the Patcher - and as a result when you try to extract files prior to this, the file basically doesn't exist.","A clear example is housing items - when you see boxes, that's the game downloading the chair model and textures compressed data (for example) from the Patcher and writing to the file.","In short, you will only extract what you've seen in-game when you try to extract a dynamic file. To avoid this issue, just always download dynamic files from the Patcher, where the game gets the info to begin with.","Here's a list of such files.","More coming soon."]}]]
